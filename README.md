# hijacked builtin classes

This lib hijacks the builtin classes to add more funcionality, as opposed
to creating new ones.

**install**
- node: `npm i hbc` or `pnpm i hbc`
- deno: add `import "https://deno.land/x/hbc/mod.ts"`

**current features:**
- `.map` for Map and Set
- `.filter` for Map and Set
- `.find` for Map and Set
- `.every` for Map and Set
- `.some` for Map and Set
